# Theory and Algorithm
- LED array mounted under the sample, a light microscope with a low-NA objective lens, and a monochromatic imaging sensor.
- Successive illumination from multiple angles: relative displacement between spectrum of sample and aperture of objective lens

- Low Resolution images from each angle
  
_Note : When the illumination angle is restricted or higher than the angle range of objective, a BF image or a dark eld (DF) scattering image is recorded_
